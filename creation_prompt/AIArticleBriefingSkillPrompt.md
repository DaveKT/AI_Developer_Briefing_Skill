I would like to create a skill that accepts a collection of links from the user and builds an AI Status briefing similar to the example provided. The audience for the briefing are developers who are adopting and using AI tools to build their products. Each briefing will always have the following sections:

- Table of Contents
- Executive Summary - a collection of the most salient points from the articles and links provided.
- Key Implications - how what is expressed in the articles could affect the way we leverage these tools in development.
- Article Briefings - A review of each or the articles similar to what is provided in the example.
- Program Guardrails and Operating Principles - A list of proposed best practices based on the content in the articles. 
 - Proposed Next Steps - A list of concrete actions the team can take to improve the safety and quality of there products as well as the agility and speed of their work.

While the author will provide links, they might also provide copies of the articles themselves. If you can't access a provided link, request that the user provide a copy of the article before generating the briefing.

Feel free to ask any clarifying questions before building the skills.
